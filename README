###ABOUT

Marker is an EE 2.x plugin that converts between Markdown and HTML. Both directions are supported, Markdown -> HTML as well as HTML -> Markdown. Markdown is the creation of John Gruber, information is here:

HTML is the creation of Tim Berners-Lee, documentation can be found with the W3C

This plugin is an encapsulation of two legendary PHP Markdown libraries. For Markdown -> HTML work I am using PHP Markdown:

For the HTLM -> Markdown work I am using Markdownify:

In both cases, Extra capabilities are in play:

###USAGE
___

There are two ways to use Marker. The first is converting from Markdown to HTML:

	{exp:marker:tohtml}
	## This is markdown
	
	You can also supply a **channel field tag** for content.
	{/exp:marker:tohtml}

This will return some nicely formatted HTML and make the world a more joyous place to live.

You can also convert from HTML to Markdown:

	{exp:marker:tomarkdown}
	<h2>This is html</h2>
	<p>You can also supply a <strong>channel field tag</strong> for content.</p>
	{/exp:marker:tomarkdown}

This can be a bit more dangerous as complex or poor HTML can loose data in the translation. For example tags with inline style can find themselves destyled once converted to Markdown. To be fair, that is really the philosophy of Markdown. __Just be aware that this IS considered a lossy conversion__.
